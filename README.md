# Implement-Data-Science-Process-Lifecycle-on-Red-Wine-Quality-Dataset
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for predicting the quality of red wine using various data science techniques. The project focuses on implementing the data science process lifecycle to analyze and predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

## Project Description

### Objective

The objective of this project is to determine which features are the best indicators of red wine quality and to generate insights into each of these factors using predictive modeling techniques. The key tasks include:

1. **Business Understanding**: Understanding the challenges in the red wine industry related to quality assessment and certification.
2. **Analytic Approach**: Applying statistical methods, linear regression, and random forest regression to analyze the data and build predictive models.
3. **Data Requirements**: Identifying the type of data required for predicting wine quality and determining key features.
4. **Data Collection**: Gathering the dataset for analysis.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
6. **Modeling**: Building and evaluating predictive models.
7. **Results**: Presenting the performance of the models and deriving insights.

## File Description
